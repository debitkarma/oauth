# OAuth for CLI apps

This is a test/toy project to learn Oauth app flow for CLI projects.

We should:
  * prompt user for username and password
  * use client id and client secret to get auth and refresh tokens
  * institute a class to manage tokens
  * use refresh tokens to get new auth tokens
  * prompt for username and password again if refresh tokens are expired
